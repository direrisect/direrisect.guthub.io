While there are some general tips that apply to all types of Anime, here are some specific recommendations for those who enjoy the genre of Anime:
-Watching a new show immediately after its release is always a great way to start an AnimeWalker day. This will give you a sense of when the next episode will air and provide you with a recap of the story before you even get started watching.
-If you&rsquo;re looking for something more drawn out, try checking out OVA&rsquo;s or one-shots before getting into the full series. These episodes usually have less action and more atmosphere, which can add to your enjoyment while giving you more closure on the story.</p><h2 id=understanding-chinese-characters>Understanding Chinese Characters<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#understanding-chinese-characters>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://www.thoughtco.com/thmb/QYgQ7JQnx0NwHx1_Zup-Sc1HXZk=/510x340/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/625px-8_Strokes_of_Han_Characters.svg-56a5e0065f9b58b7d0dedaa0.png" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.MyFguTLYMpt7yofGFBgUCQHaE8&pid=15.1"' alt="Understanding Chinese Characters"><p><em>Source: thoughtco.com</em></p><blockquote><p>chinese characters writing understanding strokes used.</p></blockquote><p>Cool wallpapers for different devices:
